- 👋 Hi, I’m Adam!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code and create apps!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of building a website from scratch, having only used drag-and-drop tools before! Html, Css, javascript, and understanding the DOM, I'm taking baby steps!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects I am hopefully starting soon! If you are just starting your journey and want someone to give feedback or join you then reach out!
- 📫 How to reach me ... Whatsyerpoison1@gmail.com :)
